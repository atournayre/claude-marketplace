Affiche le workflow et l'étape courante

---

**IMPORTANT**: Use the Skill tool to invoke the skill `dev:status` without arguments.

Execute the skill immediately. Do not explain or describe what you will do - just invoke the skill using the Skill tool.

**Note**: This slash command was auto-generated to workaround Claude Code bug #15178.
Once fixed, this workaround can be removed.
